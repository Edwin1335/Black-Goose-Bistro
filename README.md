"Learning Web Design" guide 

The Black Goose Bistro
The black goose bistro is a restaurant website created by Edwin Campuzano. 
All the contents of the website are created using a guide from a book("Leraning Web Design").

The HTML files that start with "Prac" are not part of the actual website, 
rather they are there to practice what i have learned in the current chapter that I am in.

The Images folder stores all the images needed for the restaurant site.

The Icons folder stores the SVG iconn needed for the site. 
Icons such as the Facebook icon, Instagram icon, Github icon, ..etc.
