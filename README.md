"Learning Web Design" guide 

The Black Goose Bistro
The black goose bistro is a restaurant website created by Edwin Campuzano. 
All the contents of the website are created using a guide from a book("Leraning Web Design").

The HTML files that start with "Prac" are not part of the actual website, 
rather they are there to practice what i have learned in the current chapter that I am in.

The Images folder stores all the images needed for the restaurant site.

The Icons folder stores the SVG iconn needed for the site. 
Icons such as the Facebook icon, Instagram icon, Github icon, ..etc.

The Following are very important notes from the book tha i would like to have as a guide:

1. Specify padding in any of the CSS length units (em and px are the most common) or as a percentage   of the width of the parent element.

2. Collapsing margins
Using the two paragraphs from the previous figure as an example, if the top
element has a bottom margin of 4em, and the following element has a top
margin of 2em, the resulting margin space between elements does not add
up to 6ems Rather, the margins collapse and the resulting margin between
the paragraphs will be 4em, the largest specified value. 

3. Floated Text Elements 
Always provide a width for floated text elements.
If you do not provide a width value, the width of the floated block will be
set to auto, which fills the available width of the browser window or other
containing element. Thereâ€™s not much sense in having a full-width floated
box, because the idea is to wrap text next to the float, not start below it.
