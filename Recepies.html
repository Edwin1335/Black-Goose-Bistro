        <h2>Tepanada</h2>
        <p>
            This is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at parties. My father recommends:
            <blockquote>
                "Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to bend. Just bring it up to
                room temperature before you server it. In the winter, try servin it warm."
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                This week I am extremely excited about a new
                cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In sous vide
                cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed
                in plastic) into a water bath that is <strong>precisely</strong>
                set to the target temperature you want the food
                to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>,
                Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature
                    poaching.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon
                with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef
                table, contact us before <time>November 30</time>.

                    Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not
                    pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have
                    immunity issues.
