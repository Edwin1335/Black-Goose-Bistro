Pixels Units
That said, pixels do still have their place in web design for elements that truly
should stay the same size regardless of context. Border widths are appropriate
in pixels, as are images that have inherent pixel dimensions. 

EM Units
The preferred values for font-size in contemporary web design are the relative
length units em and rem, as well as percentage values. You can specify font size
in pixels (px), but in general, they do not provide the flexibility required in
web page design.

Browser Defualt Size
To maintain the browser’s default size, set the font-size of the root element
to 100% (see Note):
html {
 font-size: 100%;
}

Fonts
In this property, the order of
the values is important:
{ font: style weight stretch variant size/line-height font-family; }

Selectors
Note that I’ve used a next-sibling selector (h2 + p) to select any
paragraph that follows an h2. 

Pseudo Class Selectors
:focus  Applies when the element is selected and ready for input
:hover  Applies when the mouse pointer is over the element
:active Applies when the element (such as a link or button) is in the
        process of being clicked or tapped

The required order for
pseudo-classes is:
:link
:visited
:focus
:hover
:active

Code
a { text-decoration: none; } /* turns underlines off for all links */
a:link { color: maroon; }
a:visited { color: gray; }
a:focus { color: maroon; background-color: #ffd9d9; }
a:hover { color: maroon; background-color: #ffd9d9; }
a:active { color: red; background-color: #ffd9d9; }
