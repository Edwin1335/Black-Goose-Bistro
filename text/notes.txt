Pixels Units
That said, pixels do still have their place in web design for elements that truly
should stay the same size regardless of context. Border widths are appropriate
in pixels, as are images that have inherent pixel dimensions. 

EM Units
The preferred values for font-size in contemporary web design are the relative
length units em and rem, as well as percentage values. You can specify font size
in pixels (px), but in general, they do not provide the flexibility required in
web page design.

To maintain the browserâ€™s default size, set the font-size of the root element
to 100% (see Note):
html {
 font-size: 100%;
}

 In this property, the order of
the values is important:
{ font: style weight stretch variant size/line-height font-family; }
